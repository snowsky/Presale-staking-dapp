## Overview

ELO stands for Effortless Order Foods.
ELO is designed to reward users for their orders.<br>
The pre-sale platform currently allows users to buy ELO tokens before our public launch.<br>
The staking functionality will allow holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards, while the trading interface is aimed at providing liquidity and facilitating transactions among users.<br>
It has features such as a user-friendly interface for purchasing tokens, wallet integration, and basic transaction tracking.<br>
Need to expand this by adding staking options to incentivize holding ELO tokens and a trading interface to provide liquidity.
